Weather Modeling with Quadratic Equations

This Java project uses quadratic equations (`ax² + bx + c = 0`) to simulate simplified weather data modeling. Think of it like this: we pretend `a`, `b`, and `c` represent atmospheric variables (like temperature, pressure, etc.), and solving the equation helps us understand "changes" in weather conditions.

1. Hard-coded input – Coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` are directly written in the code.
2. Keyboard input – User enters the values manually during runtime.
3. File input (single set) – Reads a single line of coefficients from `input.txt`.
4. File input (multiple sets) – Reads multiple sets of coefficients from `input1.txt`.
